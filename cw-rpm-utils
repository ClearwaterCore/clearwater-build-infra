# Utilities for building RPM packages
# When source-d in, the caller should pass
# $1 - the package name
# $2 - the top-level directory (i.e. the root of the repository
# $3 - the build root (provided by rpmbuild - normally rpm/BUILDROOT)
#
# Note that this script is only ever expected to be source-d into another
# script - the !/bin/bash comment above is just so that vim can do
# syntax-highlighting correctly.
